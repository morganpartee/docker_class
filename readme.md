# Practical Docker for Data Science
_These are the notes for the Docker talk on 1 or 2 AUG 2020_
_by John Partee_

The 'Development_Docker' directory is a (bad...) example of how I often use Docker for development work.

The 'Simplest' directory is a minimal working example of a Flask application, with a simple function as our predictor.

The 'Simplest_Docker' directory is the above, in docker!

The 'Database_and_Flask' dir is a bad example of how you can build multi-container apps work together, using docker compose.

The 'Database_Flask_FastAPI' dir is another (probably bad) example of how to make a distributed app, with a scalable back end.
