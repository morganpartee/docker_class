# So let's do this!  

Here's an ML/AI webapp. This projects the species of an iris flower given some specs about the sepal and petal size- Groundbreaking!

You can launch this by just running `python ./app.py`. Visit `localhost` in your browser to see what we have.

How would you use this in the real world?

You present this to your CEO, and he's excited. He wants it in production before you go home today. Ops thinks Python is a snake. What do you do?
