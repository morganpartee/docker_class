# So let's do this!  

Here's an ML/AI webapp. This projects whether or not a user is likely to die soon, given their age.

Take a look under the hood, find the ML component. (It's not real ML, lol.) But, how could you substitute that crap function for a real model? It should just be 1-2 lines of code different.

How would you use this in the real world?

Could you train the model on your workstation, pickle it, and import it?

You present this to your CEO, and he's excited. He wants it in production before you go home today. Ops thinks Python is a snake. What do you do?
